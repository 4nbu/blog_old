Can someone feed his/her family only knowing MS Excel?  Yes, it did for me for few years.  During my early days, I was learning excel and became master on it and it helped me feed my family.
<!---more--->

I started it at my college life,
* Learn to do formatting / conditional formatting
* Formulas
* Validation rules

which are very basic things a kid can easily do.  After that, I got into a part time job to prepare estimates for some Government Engineers, made me feel like __WOW!! I know everything in Excel, I can do magic with it.__  

But it didn't last for long time.  When I start going through all the formulas available, I started feeling __Oh! there's a lot to learn!!__  

As next phase, I started exploring formulas/functions such as lookups, array formulas, etc., __I started feeling comfortable.__  

But, it didn't give me the feeling that I had before.  Still, I felt something is missing.  Finally I got into pivot tables, felt like a __God!!__  

I started to rate myself 9/10 in interviews on Microsoft Excel. That also didn't last when people started asking about _vba/macros._  So I started concentrating in vba codes, macro, setting up user forms, modifying ribbon, buttons _(from Office 2007 onwards)_.  

Still, I use Excel, but if someone asks me to rate myself, I would say that __I'm an average user, trying to learn something new!!__

> You achieve mastery in something, when you really feel that, there's a lot to learn and achieve by hard work and continuous effort!!
