I have been trading Crypto Currencies for last few days. Just like to share my learnings from the trading experience.

## Introduction
Most of the people started trading CryptoCurrencies starting from 2017 as the price surged exponentially.  The CryptoCurrency trading market doesn't look green as expected.  Few things to keep in mind before start investing real money there, else you will lose money.

## Trading Lessions - The beginning
* Learn your lessions on block chain, proof of work/service, mining, nodes, etc..
* Learn to do __technical analysis__ and use all the tools that predict the future trend.
* Few sites to see the trend at various intervels:
	*  https://tradingview.com/chart/
	*  https://bitcoinwisdom.com/
	*  https://cryptowat.ch/
* Run a stimulation model and see whether you are profitable; before investing real money.
* Learn the acronyms on CryptoCurrency Trading. E.g., FOMO, FUD, REKT, etc.,
* Refer https://bitcointalk.org for the latest news and updates.
* You may lose some money at early stage as part of learning, which fine.

## Trading Lessions - The next level
* Invest money that you are able afford to lose
* Always buy the dips and sell at high. Never do it opposite.
* Do not fall on Fear of Missing Opportunity (#FOMO). 90% of the FOMO are created by simple Pump and Dump.
* Fear, Uncertinity and Doubt (#FUD) might be there all over the market, use stoploss to avoid big loss.
* Learn to manage risks. A table explains how much gain needed for each stage of loss.

| % of loss in capital | % gain required to recover loss |
| :----:| :----:|
| 10% | 11.11% |
| 20% | 25.00% |
| 30% | 42.85% |
| 40% | 66.66% |
| 50% | 100.00% |
| 60% | 150.00% |
| 70% | 233.00% |
| 80% | 400.00% |
| 90% | 900.00% |
| 100% | Broke |
* Do your own research (#DYOR) before investing; do not fall for twitter or telegram shill. The people suggest you to buy such currency are ready to dump you
* Do not aim for higher profit, which makes you greedy.  Take out your investment, when you feel safe.
* Beware of events, mostly the price would be dumped after the event is over.  A normal person expect that the price would increase further after the event.
* Play safe on arbitrage, by the time you transfer money from one exchange to another the price would have got drastically dropped.  Not all crypto currencies are transferred immediately. Few exchanges (E.g., HitBTC) do it manually, it may take days to get your money from one wallet to another.
* Always short and keep your money in fiet, the market is much volatile. So you won't REKT. 

## Things to remember
You may lose few things after involving in trading, if you do not handle properly.

* Sleep
* Health
* Peace of mind
* Relationship
* Money that you have invested

So, be aware of what you are doing!!
